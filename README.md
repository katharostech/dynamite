Dynamite is a language-agnostic scripting system for the Rust programming language. Dynamite
makes it easy to integrate scripting languages into your Rust program and is special in the way
that it orchestrates communication not only between the host program and the scripting
languages, but also allows each scripting language to interact with data in the other scripting
languages as well.

Dynamite is not currently usable, but is being developed as a component for the [Arsenal] game
engine.
